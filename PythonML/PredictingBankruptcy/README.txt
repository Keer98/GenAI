Project: Predicting Bankrupt

Requirements
Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

This project aims to predict bankruptcy risk by analyzing financial data through various machine learning models. The goal is to determine which model most accurately predicts bankruptcy and to uncover key financial metrics that significantly impact bankruptcy risk. By comparing the performance of different models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest (with and without hyperparameter tuning), this project provides insights into the predictive power and reliability of each approach.

Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 87.02%.
Decision Tree: Achieved an accuracy of 90.98%.
Random Forest: Achieved an accuracy of 94.06%.
Random Forest with Hyperparameter Tuning: Improved to 94.21% accuracy.
For each model, we assessed performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to gauge the effectiveness in predicting bankruptcy risk.
