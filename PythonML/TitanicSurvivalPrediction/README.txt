Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Plots for Titanic Dataset
This file provides descriptions and insights for the various plots generated during the EDA process on the Titanic dataset. Each plot helps in understanding different aspects of the data, particularly in exploring survival rates based on passenger class, gender, and other attributes.

1. Violin Plot for Age Distribution by Survival and Class
Violin plots show the distribution of passenger ages across different classes and survival outcomes.

2. Pair Plot for Numeric Variables Grouped by Survival
A pair plot shows pairwise relationships across multiple variables, useful for detecting patterns and correlations.

3.Facet Grid for Fare Distribution Across Passenger Classes and Survival
A FacetGrid enables analysis of the Fare variable across multiple categories, such as Passenger Class and Survival status.

4. Mosaic Plot: Survival by Sex and Passenger Class
A mosaic plot is used to display survival rates segmented by Sex and Pclass. Each cell in the plot represents a unique combination of Survived, Sex, and Pclass, and the area of each cell reflects the proportion of that combination within the dataset.

5. 3D Scatter Plot of Age, Fare, and Class with Survival as Color
A 3D scatter plot can reveal relationships between multiple features, like Age, Fare, and Class.

Conclusion
These plots provide a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, offering insights into survival rates, passenger demographics, and patterns within different passenger classes and genders. By visualizing this data, it becomes easier to understand underlying trends and factors that may have influenced survival rates, giving us a clearer picture of the Titanic tragedy.
