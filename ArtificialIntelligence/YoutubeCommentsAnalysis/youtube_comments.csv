I was harsh not wanting to let go of the Linkin Park I knew. But I can have both I can appreciate the new LP and the Old LP.

@thalyson7578,"Com o Chester ainda vivo esse 👌🏻 do Mike Shinoda, nunca quis voltar ao estilo dos primórdios do Linkin Park, como os dois primeiros álbuns de estúdio, o Hibrid Theory e o Meteora. Ficava só insistindo naquelas músicas Pop chatas e com uma má produção instrumental (com exceção do The Hunting Party). Agora, com a morte do Chester Bennington, ele quis voltar às origens do Linkin Park, como era nos primeiros dois álbuns. Só que agora com essa péssima vocalista que ele colocou no lugar do Chester.  Porque não continuou fazendo aquelas músicas Pop chatas com ela?",1 hour ago (edited)

@andre-michelgoulet6933,"Wow, how disappointing—scratch that: literally insulting. Linkin Park (early stuff, at least) was actually a really big deal to me back in the day, and it still means quite alot to me now so this pushes some buttons; one of which being ""brutal honesty"".

Have some damn respect yo, you should be ashamed of yourselves. People just don't know when to walk away with dignity anymore; and the zombie fad is sooo passé (twice now, in fact).

Straight up, the only right thing to do was to park it (lol). If Shitnoda (sorry, had to) & Co. wanted to keep going that's understandable, and with a little rebranding, as appropriate, totally cool. Hell,  you probably could have even gotten away with being greedy jerks had it been as-is, without the senseless new line-up!

But, couldn't resist trying to milk an already sold out cow long gone dry... therefore, I hereby declare that the post-Chester (a moment of silence) iteration of the band will henceforth be referred to as ""LICKIN PORK"". You're welcome!

P.S. Hope you get sued, somehow.

Somos salvos por la fe en Jesucristo, creyendo que es el único hijo de Dios que vino al mundo a morir por nuestros pecados para que seamos salvos de la condenación eterna y vivamos eternamente en su reino celestial y esto es un don de Dios,un regalo

Es tener una relación personal con Jesucristo y conocerlo a través de los medios de gracia:

-Lectura de la biblia (Palabra de Dios) Juan 17:17
-Oración (hablar con Dios) Mateo 26:41
-Participar en la Santa Cena del señor 1 Corintios 11:23  Juan 6:53-57
-Asistencia a una iglesia (congregarse con el pueblo de Dios) Hebreos 10:25
-Ayuno (abstenerse de alimentos y distracciones para buscar más a Dios) Isaías 58:6

Amando a nuestro prójimo cumplimos toda la ley y permanecemos en Jesucristo

Ser agradecidos con Dios por todo,por qué está es su voluntad

La santidad es una vida sin pecado,la santidad es un regalo para vivir una vida con buena conciencia,paz y felicidad,porque sin santidad nadie verá al señor,la santidad es la respuesta a un Dios que dio a su hijo,que dio su sangre para que  dejará de ser un rebelde condenado y sea un adorador e hijo adoptivo de Dios,vivir en santidad es posible teniendo una relación personal con Jesucristo mediante ayuda del espíritu del señor y los medios de gracia

cuando creímos en Jesucristo el hijo de Dios,Dios nos dio su vida, vida eterna,esa vida es indestructible,esa vida es la vida del hijo de Dios,una vez recibimos esa vida lo que nos corresponde es expresar esa vida,expresar la vida del hijo de Dios,conocer y comprender el amor de Dios hacia nosotros y expresar su amor a los demás
Investiguen más a profundidad esto,porque la voluntad de Dios es ver a su hijo Jesús ser expresado en la tierra
No hay que pensar que nosotros seremos salvos por nuestros mérito, nosotros somos salvos por los méritos de cristo,su sacrificio por nosotros y la vida que él vivió agradable a Dios,únicamente debemos creer que ya somos salvos al creer en el hijo de Dios,y expresar esa vida  que ya se nos dio al creer en él,como Jesús vivió amando,sirviendo y perdonando, disfrutar de la libertad en cristo para amar,no para pecar",3 hours ago

Two rap verses with no hook, two boring choruses without any memorizable melody. One breakdown which might by hard in the year 2000 but 100 bands played it harder an rougher and greater until then. And even with tons of effects und double-layers Emily sounds surpisingly thin on the growl. Will work live though.",3 hours ago

@srshk74,"Lyrics:

Last time, I was hanging by a thread (Thread)
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head (Head)
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should havе recognized
It's too late for choosing sidеs
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two faced)

Last time, you told me it wasn't true (True)
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do (Do)
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two faced)

I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle

Last time, I was hanging by a thread (Thread)
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head (Head)
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)
Last time, you told me it wasn't true (True)
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do (Do)
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle

Looking at the progress, I can see how much of your work and contribution you have made to the relaunch of the LP, I hope that Emily will be well received by the fans. He does the job and the most important thing is that he doesn't try to imitate Chester because that would be bad, he was the only one in the world and no one will ever replace him. We think about this. As LP, I wish you fire in your hearts to act and create new projects. Finally, I would say this, Mike, thank you for being able to carry it on your shoulders and rebuild everything from ZERO with the team.",6 hours ago

@SefMeteora,"Lyrics:

(kniht flesym raeh t'nac I)
(kniht flesym raeh t'nac I)
Get right!

Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointed every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
Stop yelling at me!
I can't hear myself think!
Yeah!
Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle! (Two faced!)

Is that what it is?
That's what it is
Ha-ha-ha-ha-hah

@daniyalsajid5293,"i think im going to get a lot of hate for this, but here it goes: 

The One thing that ive always loved about linkin park is their ability to adapt, transform and evolve with the time. When chester passed away it broke my heart and my-all-time favortie band at the same time. I kind of understand their attempt at recreating music from the early 2000s to show that emily is the new face of linkin park and sub-consciously replacing chester as the lead of LP. But all this just makes me miss Chester Bennington even more. Not saying that the music is bad or anything, I love the music. But it feels like im betraying Chester by listening to this. 

So come up with music that's original for Emily's persona. Because nothing can ever replace Chester for us.",7 hours ago

Get right!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like
[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

@spookyfoxpl,"My gosh! I was born in 1985. With the first LP album, I experienced also first betrayals, bullying at school, fights with older and often stronger bullies, but also first kisses, first love and first true friendship. Bands such as Payable on Death, Papa Roach, Guano Apes, Limp Bizkit, No Doubt and KoRn were going crazy on my headphones. The best times, to which I was able to return thanks to today's new song from Linkin Park. Emily here is like Gwen Stefani and Sandra Nasić from the best times! Tomorrow I'm going to pick up this album and I'm going to burn my stereo down!",8 hours ago (edited)

@ExtremelyCrafty-gg3km,"Lyrics:

[Intro: Emily Armstrong]
Get right!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Outro: Emily Armstrong & Mike Shinoda]
Is that what it is?
That's what it is
Hahahahaha

@davocabrera5132,"¿Qué les costaba hacer música como esta antes de meterse de lleno al pop con el álbum one more light y perder esa esencia que caracterizaba a Linkin Park? no se puede asegurar pero tal vez, solo tal vez Chester aun estuviera vivo porque es sabido que por las críticas de muchos ""fans"" él se hundió más en su depresión y se nos fue, todos extrañamos a ese Linkin Park que era potencia pura y que ahora parece que querer volver, lástima que ya no será lo mismo sin dos integrantes iniciales, aún así el show debe seguir...",8 hours ago

@TorridPrime217,"Well... that was extremely unimpressive. 

The song just feels like one of those 'buffer songs' you'd use to pad out an album. Its extremely repetitive and doesn't feel like it really has anything to say beyond what's said in the chorus, nor does it feels especially unique or clever, in any way. 

The video was just... what even was that?? That was even trying to recapture classic LP; that was just generic 2000s nu-metal chic, and it wasn't in any way fun or amusing to watch. 

I will say that Armstrong does sound better in this song, but given how generic and uninspired it feels, that feels more like a backhanded compliment.

The more of these songs that they debut, the more it starts to feel like LP has less of a 'new direction' and more of a 'lack of direction'",10 hours ago

@-draydogg-8939,"Дорогой Майк Шинода. Я не имею право оценивать ваш выбор солиста, но мне непонятно, почему вы делали конкурс и среди конкурсантов или финалистов этого конкурса вы не нашли достойного кандидата. Я большой фанат вашей группы, но нынешний голос хоть и другой, но нынешний солист СОВЕРШЕННО не дотягивает и близко к уровню Честера. Как вы могли сделать такой выбор мне до сих пор не понятно. В музыке чувствуется драйв и дух того самого Линкин Парка, а солист все портит. Можете сказать что Я ничего не понимаю и рефлексирую по старым временам старого состава группы. Честер не уходил, он остался в группе навсегда. Я считаю что среди финалистов были замечательные голоса которые на порядок превосходят то что есть сейчас. С уважением",10 hours ago
