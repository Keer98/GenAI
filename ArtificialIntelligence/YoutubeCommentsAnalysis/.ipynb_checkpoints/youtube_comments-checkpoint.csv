@srshk74,"Lyrics:

Last time, I was hanging by a thread (Thread)
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head (Head)
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should havе recognized
It's too late for choosing sidеs
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two faced)

Last time, you told me it wasn't true (True)
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do (Do)
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two faced)

I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two faced)",18 minutes ago (edited)

Last time, I was hanging by a thread (Thread)
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head (Head)
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)
Last time, you told me it wasn't true (True)
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do (Do)
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

Too late, countin' to zero

@SefMeteora,"Lyrics:

(kniht flesym raeh t'nac I)
(kniht flesym raeh t'nac I)
Get right!

Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointed every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
Stop yelling at me!
I can't hear myself think!
Yeah!
Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!

Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle! (Two faced!)

Is that what it is?
That's what it is

@daniyalsajid5293,"i think im going to get a lot of hate for this, but here it goes: 

The One thing that ive always loved about linkin park is their ability to adapt, transform and evolve with the time. When chester passed away it broke my heart and my-all-time favortie band at the same time. I kind of understand their attempt at recreating music from the early 2000s to show that emily is the new face of linkin park and sub-consciously replacing chester as the lead of LP. But all this just makes me miss Chester Bennington even more. Not saying that the music is bad or anything, I love the music. But it feels like im betraying Chester by listening to this. 

So come up with music that's original for Emily's persona. Because nothing can ever replace Chester for us.",2 hours ago

Get right!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like
[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Intro: Emily Armstrong]
Get right!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginnin' to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think, yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Outro: Emily Armstrong & Mike Shinoda]
Is that what it is?
That's what it is

@TorridPrime217,"Well... that was extremely unimpressive. 

The song just feels like one of those 'buffer songs' you'd use to pad out an album. Its extremely repetitive and doesn't feel like it really has anything to say beyond what's said in the chorus, nor does it feels especially unique or clever, in any way. 

The video was just... what even was that?? That was even trying to recapture classic LP; that was just generic 2000s nu-metal chic, and it wasn't in any way fun or amusing to watch. 

I will say that Armstrong does sound better in this song, but given how generic and uninspired it feels, that feels more like a backhanded compliment.

The more of these songs that they debut, the more it starts to feel like LP has less of a 'new direction' and more of a 'lack of direction'",6 hours ago

@-draydogg-8939,"Дорогой Майк Шинода. Я не имею право оценивать ваш выбор солиста, но мне непонятно, почему вы делали конкурс и среди конкурсантов или финалистов этого конкурса вы не нашли достойного кандидата. Я большой фанат вашей группы, но нынешний голос хоть и другой, но нынешний солист СОВЕРШЕННО не дотягивает и близко к уровню Честера. Как вы могли сделать такой выбор мне до сих пор не понятно. В музыке чувствуется драйв и дух того самого Линкин Парка, а солист все портит. Можете сказать что Я ничего не понимаю и рефлексирую по старым временам старого состава группы. Честер не уходил, он остался в группе навсегда. Я считаю что среди финалистов были замечательные голоса которые на порядок превосходят то что есть сейчас. С уважением",6 hours ago

@danielwitham1791,"Straight up, this doesn't do it for me and I just have to express that with deep honesty. 

I'm a 1986 model. Linkin Park got big as I came into legal age. I've seen them too many times to count when I include short festival shows with their headline shows. I've been drumming for 30yrs, 26 semi to full pro and this just doesn't hit me with any amount of musical feels. 

I feel you should have changed the band name and started fresh. This just craps on the LP myself and many other's grew up loving or have only recently found out. I'm surprised more people aren't commenting this and have a feeling it's got to do with not wanting to be ribbed on because, you know who is dead. Deaths don't change facts and bands deserve constructive, truthful, feedback and criticism. 

Thanks for the 2000s releases and shows. I'll never forget them. Well done on all your achievements and all the best with this new thing. 

I'll show myself out. Peace and love ❤",7 hours ago

It kinda sounds the same as older songs, but I think LP does this in general. They do use a lot of heavy guitar, and samples in their songs. Also the slower parts, with a heavy metal section later.

It's why we love them, no need to change that. If you looked at One More Light, you see why some didn't like that change. It wasn't a bad album as some make you believe, but a different vibe/style as HT/MT.",8 hours ago (edited)

A few minutes in, tearing down the road at 140 mph, and bam—the cops catch sight of you. Suddenly, this heavy metal track kicks in. The adrenaline’s pumping, you’re gripping the controller, heart pounding. You’re half-focused on dodging cop cars, half-lost in the music that’s blasting, every scream and guitar riff feeding into the hype. Chills run down your spine, dopamine flooding your brain.

@aikahann," @Diddly0  Not all of it. The music video for Over Each Other they recorded in South Corea while they were there for a concert in the middle of the tour. This might as well had been recorded in between concerts. Either way, it's not like it was filmed a year ago, and she's clearly getting more comfortable with time, not only on camera but in concerts as well. I saw them less than two weeks ago in Paris and she was still very shy, comparing to what I saw form the concerts in Bogota this week.",8 hours ago (edited)
@aikahann," @TzvetozarCherkezov  Dude, they are literally recording music videos in between concerts. Have you seen the LPTV for the Over Each Other MV, recorded in South Corea, while they were there for a concert? A year ago no one knew except for the band members that they were getting back together, why do you think that this tour is so squizophrenic, being in Europe one day, in the US the other, and then to South America next week? They couldn't have anything done before the news being public or they couldn't keep a secret, and now they are doing all at once.",8 hours ago

It's not just about this video, but how she's getting more comfortable with time to be herself in another band, with a completely different and much bigger fan base, carrying a legacy that, a year ago, wasn't her responsibility. What do you want me to say regarding your comment? It's obvious that this is an MV, and there's directing (by Joe, btw) and script. It changes nothing regarding her behavior changing in general.",8 hours ago

@warrior1477,"I can't imagine how happy these guys are right now. I've heard Mike say that things were tough during the Hybrid Theory and Meteora time. With Chester getting high, disappearing and then the next day nobody being able to talk to him, cuz he was so dark. It was a hard time for them all. They were young and inexperienced. But now I imagine this feels amazing. Because now they HAVE the experience, they are recognized, for being one of the best bands in the world and are respected.  I'm not saying it was always bad, but I do remember Chester or Mike saying once that if they could do it all over again, they would do it differently or something like that, but if they were a bunch of kids struggling to keep it together before, now I see them as a bunch of kids just having the fun of their life! And I am so happy for them and that they got to this point where they can make new music. I get the feeling that this whole album is supposed to pay respects to old school Linkin Park, because of how you can hear old songs when you listen to the new stuff. Loving every second of it. LP will always be the best :)",9 hours ago

Last time I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I’m not but I’m in it over my head
That’s when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

Last time you told me it wasn’t true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn’t do
So that’s why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero

@scottee2hottee,No. Mike always was the most important band member in terms of influence and decision making. He let Chester be the face of the band and he is letting Emily be the face now because Mike never wanted attention on himself or to feel like a celebrity. Ego was never a problem in Linkin Park,10 hours ago
@nikahaziny,"Mike is literally the main writer in LP, Chester even said it in multiple interviews.
You people hate on the band because they're ""disrespecting Chester"" but you guys are the ones disrespecting him with these comments, you can't even bother to watch a couple of interviews, like that time the label wanted to take Mike off the vocals and just let Chester be the only vocalist but Chester refused, Linkin Park is Mike's baby, even Chester knew that.",10 hours ago

His screams are great, even tonalities within the album, in which he emulates those things very well, or can you argue in a technical way, why the screams are not good? Why isn't it Chester? Will they still be holding on to it?

@SatoFernando," @tertozer3543  But the melodic choruses with energy, is something that Linkin Park has always done from the beginning, it is not ""pop"", in reality, songs like Numb or In The end, are more pop, they belong to a popular current, they are songs that everything world hears and knows, they have always belonged to the pop movement, it is not something new, but with its own essence, achieving a perfect balance between aggressiveness and melody, here you have, the turntables, electronic elements, and that alone with them Also, the screams are great, all those elements have always been from the old school LP. They simply hate, because it's not Chester who sings, when it was done with him, exactly the same thing. They have no idea about the sound of the band, or about the music, they comment on pure nonsense, it's complaining just for the sake of complaining",8 hours ago (edited)

@missystarr975,"I respect the suit attire. It just feels more respectful and evolved for them starting again until everyone calms down and has had the  time to process the great loss of their very talented lead singer. I as a Linkin Park fan seriously appreciate their dedication and respect and hard work, themselves transit into moving forward with their career goals but also in away always knew that they all had a huge impact on all of us and they wanted to help us through the grief process to given us closure within our heartbreak and I’m very happy to eagerly see and learn more about their amazing leading badass new addition. 
I was hurt at first but then I realized I love this group equally and would’ve been heartbroken if of the other members had taken that path that Chester took. 
I’m excited for the future and it’s been a long time to have had said that and Linkin Park is legendary and I miss them, it makes me want to turn on the latest top 100 and just be so proud and honestly helped me feel better about this world because through everything going on right now, my soul is crushing and I’m terrified about the music industry but these guys feel like a special safe space, home feeling.

You realise Chester would hate you, right? Mike started the band. It's not soulless for him to want to continue after years of processing losing his friend. If you watch any of the interviews they've done, you can see how passionate they are about it; they didn't even plan to come back properly until they just felt like working together felt right.

@Allan-irspa,"In One Step Closer, the lyrics resonate with frustration and a desire to escape pressure, almost like a breaking point where anger and rebellion become outlets. It's youthful, raw, and filled with the need to push back against external forces or people who misunderstand, control, or confine. The repeated refrain, ""One step closer to the edge, and I'm about to break,"" captures this intense, almost explosive energy that many fans connected with as an anthem of defiance and self-expression.

Two Faced, on the other hand, seems to take this inner conflict to a more mature, introspective level. It’s not just about rebelling or breaking away; it’s about looking inward, dealing with feelings of betrayal and the realization of inner conflicts. Where One Step Closer feels like a reaction to outside pressures, Two Faced deals with the duality within — wrestling with self-trust and the complexity of personal relationships, where even close connections can feel deceptive. There’s an underlying maturity, almost as if the anger has transformed into a reflection on the complexities and betrayals that come with growth.

Both songs seem to explore the theme of inner and outer conflict, but Two Faced brings a more layered, introspective edge to the frustration Linkin Park first expressed in One Step Closer. It's like an artist evolving from needing to shout out loud to quietly grappling with the shadows within.

Linkin Park, as a band, has always been good at evolving this way — starting with raw emotions and then diving deeper into the nuanced layers of struggle. It’s a kind of artistic maturity that acknowledges both the need to scream and the need to understand what lies behind that scream.",12 hours ago

@jopearson6321,"I mean, I get what they're going for thematically. But sometimes I feel like the only LP fan who isn't interested in revisiting Hybrid Theory / Meteora; not even for a flying visit. I'd rather they did totally new stuff and kept exploring the musical landscape. I always liked LPs genre-switching and experimentation. This track is decently executed, but falls into the uncanny valley for me. Its reasonably clever, but I feel like a lot of this album is focused on transitioning respectfully between eras, because they're worried about handling things sensitively after Chester. While in theory this subtext can make for interesting emotional material and artistic tension, I think in practice it has hamstrung this album a bit because it is too volatile/delicate a topic. I already somewhat like some songs, but I hardly love them. At this point I'm more interested in the album after, when they'll probably feel looser and less constrained. I can't blame them, as its a tough situation. But for me as a fan, at a great distance, it all feels way too safe and tentative (aside from that great reveal concert).",12 hours ago

@dimaink,"@михалконстантиныч  давай начнём с того, что гитару писал не он. И было много лет для этого. Он мог только отобрать не самые лучшие треки. Книгу почитай, как продюсер пинал их за музыку. Ибо они изначально писали полу-хиты. А Шинода обиделся на него и не хотел работать с ним после гибрида. Это тот самый продюсер который Честера привёл. А Шиноду лейбл хотел заменить.",10 hours ago (edited)

@freyja802,"This sounds so much like the Linkin Park i fell in love with 20 years ago, yet it's also something wholly different which Linkin Park never was before. Since you came back, I waited to hear Emily perform in this kind of song, experience her singing against Mike's raps and to see if it's still the same thing I loved so much. It's not. Emily has such a different vibe - but it's good. It's something else but not in a bad way. Would not say that it's better either. Just different. Yet another new musical Hybrid which flawlessly continues the line of Linkin Park's prior iteration while once again and as usual, standing strongly on its own feet with no need to invoke old fame. I love what you're doing, ressurecting the project without trying to bring Chester back from the dead. Moving forward, changing, living. I look at Linkin Park and I see years over years of new iterations as the band lives and the music naturally evolves everything in life does. I wonder where this journey will lead but I am happy that I get to experience the songs you create.

But frankly: I don't get the lyrics. It's never too late to pick a side, just go against the other side and you're in. But what's the point of that? Isn't being multifaceted and in between so many different extremes what makes us humans so special?",12 hours ago

@VERGIL...-,"If you are wondering why he said ""since 2006"" that's because that was the last time anything Nu Metal came out from Linkin Park which was a quick song recorded whilst the band was on tour in Japan called ""Qwerty""
After that there was no Nu Metal song until today 










(Minutes to Midnight's 4 go hard rock songs were Alternative Rock songs
A Thousand Suns'es only remotely rock song , Blackout , felt more electronic than it was Rock but sure it has some traces of rock but again it just falls into Alternative Rock
Living Things'es few go hard songs felt more like a fusion between EDM and Rock but there may have been some small traces of Nu Metal because some of those songs were made for the fans but obviously it still wasn't Nu Metal

Get right

Last time I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I’m not but I’m in it over my head
That’s when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

Last time you told me it wasn’t true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn’t do
So that’s why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

@IMilla-wz9vh,​ @ZERO-X79  everyone can have his own opinion. Just that ur opinion is not good xd. She is the BEST replace cause he is not trying to imitate Chester but doing her own thing.

@trito31,"Lyrics :

[Intro: Emily]
​kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
​kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
Get right!

[Verse 1: Mike]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Tryna say I'm not, but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge


[Pre-Chorus: Mike]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Verse 2: Mike]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointin' every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missin' the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Bridge: Emily]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think
Yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily]
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late, countin' to zero
Countin' to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two-faced)

[Outro: Emily & Mike]
Is that what it is?
That's what it is
Hahahahaha

@scottkim1646,"throughout high school, linkin park was the melody of my youth which i indentified with the most as i struggled through the challenges of growing up, loving and hating the relationships that i had been a part of, and healing from emotional scars that linger with me still. the lyrics from hybrid theory and meteora resonated with me, and i felt like there were people i could relate to outside of the isolation i felt at times from others in my day to day. my mom took her own life while i was at college, and life doubled down on loss just a handful of years later with chester's departure from this world right after. the period of time that ensued was a slient stretch of years that was characterized by a gradual loss of identity, with my foundation of friends and family moving farther away, knocking down my sense of self and worth that i defined through them. now approaching my mid thirties, i feel like im at a similar crossroads, starting all over again as i transition to find a new perspective on life. thats what it is.",15 hours ago

@คนดีที่ไม่จําเป็น,"I admit that if I were to talk about Linkin Park, I would not hesitate to say that for me, it would be Chester Bennington. But that does not mean that EMILY ARMSTRONG is not suitable or not worthy of Linkin Park. Today, after EMINEM posted when Linkin Park first introduced Emily Armstrong at a concert at Kia Forum in California, many media outlets attacked and criticized Emily in a negative way, causing her to shed tears after the show. Eminem came out to defend her, which made Emily very touched by what happened. So I went to listen to Linkin Park in the EMILY ARMSTRONG era. She is very charming and has her own unique style. I think she is someone who should be respected more.",15 hours ago

@Rob.Hinkley,"Give me a break. I can't believe everyone seems to be lapping this up. This is NOT Linkin Park, it's awful. 

If Mike and the others wanted to keep going, change the band name name, and let the Linkin Park legacy go out on a high when Chester died.

This is so generic, it sounds nothing like them, and just craps all over everything that was done in the past. Chester was irreplaceable. Chester was the sound of Linkin Park. 

Emily, to her credit, sounds incredible, but this is not the Linkin Park I know and love. Stop saying it's a new direction/new sound/phoenix rising from the ashes crap. It's just Mike passing it off as Linkin Park to try and use the band's reputation to sell more records. To build on the popularity of an established band, rather than having the courage to start new, with a new name.",15 hours ago

@Rob.Hinkley," @GeekMilitia  That's fine. Each to their own. We've really only heard one side of the ""new Linkin Park"". I'll reserve judgement to see if there is a more softer side like ""Castle of Glass"", ""Roads Untravelled"", etc, and how they sound. All we're hearing are snippets of what LP used to be and Emily screaming on most of them.

To me, Linkin Park had a trademark sound you could identify in seconds thanks to Chester's brilliance and vocals, but what i've heard so far, just sounds more generic. It's not bad (by any means), it's just not as good as what the true Linkin Park put out.",14 hours ago

@avyanschannel,"I will forever miss Chester, there's no replacing him, but people forget that Mike Shinoda is just as important. If their places were reversed and Chester was the one who survived, we would be feeling Mike's absence in painful waves too.

Mad props to Emily, she's an outstanding singer in her own right, and she's doing an awesome job following Mike's lead toward a new chapter of one of my most beloved bands ever.

And even with the new twists and tweaks, this right here is undeniably the signature Linkin Park sound that I've come to know and love. Whether it was intended or not (which I highly suspect it was), I distinctly hear some musical and lyrical callbacks to some of my favorite tunes from their earlier albums, like A Place for My Head, One Step Closer, Figure 09, and Faint.

This is absolutely fantastic, I'm so glad that you guys are still making music, and I hope to keep listening to more of your tunes for many more years to come!",16 hours ago

@jeanfrancoreyesvargasmachu4329,"Very simple lyrics, a video with no link to the song (they just decided to go out in a suit and that's it), the rhythm and melody are also basic. Don't just stop at ""it's a great song"" just because the name of the video says linkin park. This song is forgettable, but I'm sure I will receive criticism for criticizing Linkin Park, although I have been open to this new version from the beginning. But in the end the real judge will be the number of songs they play in 5 or 10 years when they release new albums, because at concerts they only play the memorable songs. With one more light it happened that they gave it value for Chester's death and now they criticize the songs. I'm a Linkin Park fan, but we have to be more objective when judge a song and not praise anything they give us.",17 hours ago

@ahsanjahangir9540,"2024 Is the new Era of linkin park where we got Emily Armstrong as a singer.  But I'm never gonna forget the olden Era of it. Two years ago I discovered this band , until then I used to listen imagine dragons songs. But one year ago I got a video with the title ""36 HOURS BEFORE CHESTER BENNINGTON DIED"". The thumbnail of video was that singer then I came to know his name at the same time I saw that video which was funny. But I did research then came to know that he committed suicide due to huge depression. Then I again watched this video then it was a emotional video. This singer made an Era on YouTube maybe from 2007 to 2023. Now maybe in future new fans becomes fan of Emily but I'm expecting their reaction when they'll come to that before Emily there was a great singer died. CHESTER is better than other singers for example when you compare with Dan Reynolds his voice in official  music video and live voice is totally different,  exactly with Ed Sheeran.  But Chester's voice is same in live stream. RIP to him.",17 hours ago

The Synth in the background of the intro sounds somewhat like the Synth being played in the song Heavy Is The Crown. Also, the entire guitar section (or the entire instrimental section rather) feels so much like Hybrid Theory, but still so much ""modern"" (makes sense? Idk sorry). The scratch solo was 🔥. Always love that!❤
Also the MV, this was such an evolution! Absolutely different, and I love it! ❤️ And the last few seconds where Emily and Mike were talking was 😂 but a nice touch.

@Dandelions479,"That's not fair. Maybe the most ""classic"" LP sounding song but no one but Linkin Park gets to decide what Linkin Park sounds like- they're great for their evolution.

It's not fair to say anything after Meteora isn't Linkin Park, they poured their hearts and soul into everything in between and if it's not for you then it's not for you- but the only people who can define a band is the band themselves and their evolution is what makes them great.

(I want the original commenter to know that I'm sure they had no ill intentions, the song is nostalgic af and great, but I had to vent my frustration at people who say MtM, ATS, LT, etc isn't Linkin Park and this comment happened to be on my feed. Agree or disagree I hope you enjoy the album!",17 hours ago

@denyfixe1000,"Cara... Os cara voltaram as origens... SÓ AGORA.

L-A-M-E-N-T-Á-V-E-L

Como fã da banda, fico sem reação de saber que após a decepção do Living Things que não trouxe o som que muitos de nós fãs esperávamos e a perda de mão e até certo desrespeito do The Hunting Party que só foi feito ""pra calar nossas bocas"" sendo que sonoramente ele NÃO chega perto dos primeiros álbuns, os caras simplesmente voltaram ás origens do Linkin Park (do Hybrid Theory até a música QWERTY).

Esse deveria ser um dos momentos mais felizes da minha vida, mas não é. Eu achei interessante a proposta da banda e gostei das músicas anteriores, mas essa aqui foi um soco no estômago pois é um sonho meu (e de muitos fãs) que se realizou COMPLETAMENTE ATRASADO, não tem o que comemorar. É claro que é maravilhoso ver o Linkin Park SENDO o Linkin Park, mas ERA MELHOR TER ACABADO A BANDA EM VEZ DE TRAZER ESTE SOM DE VOLTA, NAMORAL. Essa é a minha opinião e eu respeito a opinião de quem gostou e tals, eu AMEI a música, mas não consigo ficar feliz por isso, é oficial, não sou mais fã do Linkin Park. Primeiro deixei de ser fã do Slipknot por terem feito aquela puta sacanagem com o Joey Jordison sem contar o som genérico atual da banda, agora o Linkin Park me volta ás origens depois do Chester morrer.",18 hours ago

@eumeodeiosouumlixo,"Ahhh não ACREDITOOOO!

Linkin Park acabou de lançar mais uma música para a playlist das músicas que não conseguimos parar de ouvir todos os dias!

Eu estou ficando muito impressionado com a produção dos clipes, estou amando os efeitos visuais e as edições que eles estão colocando! 
Esse clipe ficou maravilhoso, além da música ser incrível!
Aquele Riff do início grudou facilmente na cabeça! Kkkkk


Esse álbum tem tudo para ser um sucesso porque até para um fã recente como eu, é facilmente perceptível o quanto que eles estão mantendo a essência dos primeiros álbuns! Aqueles do efeitos do Dj Hahn acompanhando os Screams da Emily me fizeram voltar a ""One Step Closer"" quando o Hahn faz uns efeitos bem parecidos enquanto o Chester gritava ""Shut Up when I""m talkin to you, shut up!""

A simplicidade que torna aquele primeiro Riff de guitarra tão marcante e gruda na nossa mente me fez lembrar daquele riff no início de ""A place for my head"".
Além de aquele vocal sussurrado que a Emily faz dizendo ""I can't hear myself think"" me deu muita nostalgia porque lembra muito o Chester sussurrando "" You try to take the best of me, go away!"" em ""A place for my head!""

Estou amando ver eles usando os elementos clássicos que nós fans tanto amamos!",18 hours ago

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!
[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think
Yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
[Post-Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two faced)

[Outro: Emily Armstrong, Mike Shinoda]
Is that what it is?

personal opinion, but— if you love Chester, you should love the present vocalist, the present Linkin Park.

not to give credit, Chester is Chester, he is himself— great and one of the GOAT.

but Emily has herself too, she is herself.

LINKIN PARK IS LINKIN PARK !

Im not a hater I just find it hard to connect with this new voice and style. Good marketing though. On the other side bands are dead, nowadays there are only single singer as that is much prefer by music production companies as so it is much appreciated a band tries to survive in this sh*ty new music world where the music spirit is almost completely gone so in that respect this new LP is a blow of fresh air in its own way.

As for her past we all have messed up and regretting (or regretted) it, if any of you ""fans"" haven't messed up in the past once or numerous times, either as a kid, a teenager or in adulthood is a liar.  She didn't deserve the backlash from any of the linkin park fans, seriously is that how you treat a band that you supposedly loved...no it isn't. Lets flip the tables how would any of those haters appreciate bacl;ash over something happend but you wrote a statement but no that wasn't good enough according to few so-called lying ""fans"".

@avirupbhattacharya5581,"Listening to this takes me back to the days when everything felt complete. Linkin Park brings back memories, Noni. Some memories never fade, no matter how far apart we are now. Even when everything seems lost, some things—like what we shared—never really fade. Some things are just too deeply rooted to let go. Ghooghi, I hope you still feel the music in this, just like we used to.❤☺️",19 hours ago

[Intro: Emily Armstrong]
Kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
Kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
Get right

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!
[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think
Yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
[Post-Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle (Two faced)

[Intro: Emily Armstrong]
Kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
Kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
Get right

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!
[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think

[Breakdown: Emily Armstrong]
Stop yelling at me
I can't hear myself think
Yeah
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me
Stop yelling at me

[Chorus: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle

Even Chester said himself before that he thinks the band isn’t bigger than any of their individual selves. That’s what most timeless bands are made of. I also don’t think she cares about being compared. Seems like her and the rest of them are having fun and making bangers again like always.,14 hours ago (edited)

It's Linkin Park in it's essence. Combines everything that makes this band who they are.
Emily's fantastic singing an screaming, Mikes edgy rapping, Joes classic scratching and the catchy melody that's completed by Collins furious drumming, the carrying Guitars from Brad and of course the unmatched bass from Dave. 😊

The music video reminds me a little bit of One Step Closer🤔

Last time I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I’m not but I’m in it over my head
That’s when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

Last time you told me it wasn’t true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn’t do
So that’s why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

@dejanjugovski1978,"Linkin Park has once again united the power of sound and emotion, blending melancholic lyrics with an energetic rhythm. This song not only brings us back to the nostalgia of their classic sound but also brings a fresh perspective, as a fusion of past and present. The powerful voice and deep lyrics resonate with anyone who has ever felt trapped within themselves, while also serving as a reminder that there’s always a light visible through the darkness. Linkin Park once again proves they are a symbol of resilience and transformation.

Every influential person who’s involved is rightfully questioned about it by normal people who always get ignored, people may watch every Tom Cruise movie but most also talk about his ties to the church too. Let’s not forget Emily publicly went to support a Scientologist friend on trial for r*ping several women with a group of other Scientologists, some of whom harassed one of  the victims. Btw Ashton Kutcher & Mila Kunis’ entire reputation was ruined just for writing character letters for this person, going out with your friends to support a potential r*pist who’s connected to you by Scientology IS a bad look.

@huongtrinh6547,"Didnt know i needed LP in suits in my life, huh... also, Figure.90 ??? 

Seems this album serves as a reminder of the eclectic sound of Linkin Park, sometimes heavier ie. Casualty. Excellent for a comeback album, but I'll be expecting a bit more sonic & thematic cohesiveness in their following records. This lineup has great potential though, and from the podcast, it seems their artistic synergy is quite remarkable. Colin seems like the type to bring new sounds to their instrumental arrangements and Emily seems like the type to excel vocally at any rock/alternative/metal-adjacent genre thrown at her. They have a high ceiling & a pretty solid floor. I wouldnt call this record the next evolution in their sounds (which honestly i wasnt expecting lol), but it does showcase the sonic identity of Linkin Park and makes for a great entry point for new fans.

Honestly, props to them for what they've achieved this album cycle. ""The hardest part of ending is starting again,"" right?

Either do something else or don't call it Linkin Park. and there is no need for me to talk about the revival of the group, you are only tearing open my sore wound. to be reborn and do something different is one thing, but to stubbornly continue to write songs to Chester is another. my heart bleeds from what is happening to my favorite band. greedy for profit. only commerce. call this project Armstrong/Shinoda and keep creating. and there will be success, and there will be love, and there will be respect. “Lies, greed and misery”.",21 hours ago

""Get right

Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two-faced
Caught in the middle

Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two-faced

Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

I’m not wasting my time talking about what she was a part of when she was younger and holding it against her like Mental Amanda or anyone else does.

@CarlosHuiskens,FYI but From Zero is not an EP. The term EP means Extended Play and is usually used for shorter records. Take Bring Me The Horizon's Post Human: Survival Horror for example. From Zero is simply an Album which sometimes is also called an LP which means Long Play.,21 hours ago
@CarlosHuiskens,Yes and No. While I wouldn't mind seeing Alex within the music videos he also doesn't work on the songs themselves and is only touring with LP. It's the same with Bring Me The Horizon's touring gitarist. But if they someday do an official music video from a live performance then he'll be present.,21 hours ago

@ikadee4923,"Get right!

Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind
I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle
Two facеd!

Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind
I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
Stop yelling at me!
I can't hear myself think!

Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!

@joaochanoca3317,"It's funny isn't it? If it is a drummer being replaced... Sure... Now the singer, omg no no no... I hate it... Like a kid in middle school... Do you guys even listen to other bands? Or even work in companies? People being replaced in this world is normal... And in the end it was Chester decision to end his life... Many fans didn't even liked their last album... Fans can't adapt to new styles of songs, can't adapt to new voices... It's just the worst disease out there...

People that can't move forward are the worst disease... They have some difficult times... Even on their hobbies where they should let some stress go away they bring their anxiety and their hatred... These compact minded people with no adaptability is what ruins the world...

Over Each Other was too plain an sounded like any other generic song and the lyrics didn't sound that creative especially with how repetitive ""Over each other"" was throughout the song.

(I'm not saying they have to be depressed to make good music but the raw emotions is missing, i feel like its just lyrics put together to meet the req of what once linkin park was as a persona.)

@ReidGarwin,"​ @twilyte9557  they should in my opinion. Not every band should continue on, especially if they can't keep evolving their sound and mature.

@Tolandruth, @twilyte9557  I like what they have released so far and this isnt even a LP thing but the lead singer is the band no one but die hard fans know the instrument players. So when lead leaves/dies they can continue to make music but its not the same band anymore.,21 hours ago

@lisalancaster6510, @runkstrunks I think Chester would be genuinely proud as he always thought of himself if you watched any of his interviews he always saw himself as just apart of the band and never viewed linkin park as his band he even said that it was mikes band at several points and knowing how selfless Chester was he would probably be happy just knowing they are still creating music and are happy like even tho I may not agree with all of the directions they take and don’t really think Emily was the best option I still know for a fact Chester would be happy knowing they are still making music,20 hours ago

@Ezackiel1,"idk..  it's melodic and well coordinated
such music back in the days id say I didn't really cared it was aggressive, but now I kinda crave good positive vybes and constructive music
I mean..  it's always about you are a disgrace a traitor a moron a two faced someone that doesn't know better etc etc..  it's never about good qualities of humans !!
I thought they'd have learned from the past..  I guess this is their style

Muse isn't that of a positive vybe all the time neither, but they have some great Hits about Humanity and it's strenght..  their music is about understanding our flaws and cons and constructing around it !!  they make albums about actual stuff going on 
id say Muse is much more something id listen to nowadays

maybe I'm old
got tired of Music telling me I'm garbage and now I crave music that tells me the way

@ABCurry30,"LYRICS:

Get right

Last time I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I’m not but I’m in it over my head
That’s when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

Last time you told me it wasn’t true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn’t do
So that’s why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

I can’t hear myself think

@dimasaditia5945,"[Intro: Emily Armstrong]
Kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
Kniht flesym raeh t'nac I
Get right!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I'm not but I'm in it over my head
That's when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge


[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus 1: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognizеd
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in thе middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Last time, you told me it wasn't true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn't do
So that's why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Your truth's not rigid, your rules aren't fair
The dark's too vivid, the light's not there
I start to give in, but I can't bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

[Chorus 2: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced!

[Bridge: Emily Armstrong]
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
I can't hear myself think
Stop yelling at me!
I can't hear myself think!
Yeah!
Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!
Stop yelling at me!

[Chorus 3: Emily Armstrong]
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It's too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle

[Outro: Emily Armstrong, ?]
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle!
Caught in the middle! (Two faced!)

[Studio Banter: Emily Armstrong, Mike Shinoda]

@wtatsea,"LYRICS:

Get right

Last time I was hanging by a thread
Trying to say I’m not but I’m in it over my head
That’s when I figured out where it led
Beginning to realize that you put me over the edge

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

Last time you told me it wasn’t true
And pointing every finger at things that you didn’t do
So that’s why I kept missing the clues
And never realized that the one that did it was you

Your truth’s not rigid, your rules aren’t fair
The dark’s too vivid, the light’s not there
I start to give in, but I can’t bear
To put it all behind, I run into it blind like

Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Too late
Counting to zero
Counting to zero
You should have recognized
It’s too late for choosing sides
Two faced
Caught in the middle
Caught in the middle
Two faced

Oh yeah. Because there's no MIKE SHINODA in those other bands. Looks like Chester aren't as godly as you fanboys made him out to be. He's a talent of a generation, that point is undebateable.

I think you also need to tell that to AC/DC when Bon Scott died and you also need to tell Stone Temple Pilots when they hired Chester as their new vocalist.

Bro, it's their band. Mike is the leader of Linkin Park since it's very beginning as ""Xero"" and will always ever be that way until eternity. I'm all for him keep continuing LP despite the loss of ""the person who helped them popular"". It's not his fault that his co-vocalist died the way it is and he had no restrictions whatsoever to keep continuing his band.

And also if the band keep being successful without ""the person that made them popular"" you are referring to. Then that person ain't exactly the only reason that made them popular.",20 hours ago (edited)

@timmlyy,Their first label signed Linkin Park because Brad had connections. not because they thought Chester was the best thing ever. Chester auditioned to join Linkin Park because his thing wasn't working,19 hours ago

@zombine555,"​ @scovafd ...no? I think of the whole package. The drums. Chester's screams, Mike's rap... thr band is not Chester, and he and the rest of the band would be insulted to hear you say that.",18 hours ago
@scovafd," @zombine555  you're out of your mind if you've read anything I've posted as ""everyone but Chester is irrelevant""

the whole reason I even commented was because someone pretty much said the band is Mike's band and Chester was practically lucky to be there 

Everyone in the band is important, and its not LP without the lead singer who was a massive MASSIVE reason for why the band was so successful. Without Chester, LP isn't the global phenomenon it became, and anyone who tries to disagree wasn't around or is delusional",18 hours ago

@wolfpack929,​ @Lovely-vy4hs Chester put a soul into lyrics and band...

Better change the brand name...,12 hours ago
